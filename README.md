# Rasbian-WebMaker 

A custom [Rasbian](https://www.raspbian.org/) based SD-card image with [Mozilla Webmaker](https://webmaker.org/en-US/about) tools on Raspberry Pi. The project uses the most minimal setup without any connectivity to Internet. The [Raspberry Pi](http://raspberrypi.org/) Server will host Web maker tools like [Thimble](https://thimble.webmaker.org/en-US) with some learning 
templates. The users could connect to the server with WiFi from their laptops or using school computers using local Ethernet connection.

The goal was to finish the project by [MozFest East Africa](http://mozfestea.org/2015/) in July, 2015 and release it for testing.

If you are interested to help with the testing and then I highly recommend downloading the testing image [here](https://mega.nz/#!I9dyHLyI!495mj_7GmdLb3dH9XgzGq_MBTFSi2iFpWyNovZxpZT4)
